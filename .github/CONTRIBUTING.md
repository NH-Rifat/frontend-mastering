# Contributing to Frontend Mastering

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Frontend Mastering! This project aims to create a comprehensive resource for advanced frontend concepts with both theoretical explanations and practical implementations.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Document advanced frontend concepts clearly
- Provide working code examples for each concept
- Create a resource that helps developers level up their skills
- Build a community-driven knowledge base

   ```

### 3. Adding a New Concept

When adding a new concept, please include:

1. **Documentation** (`concepts/your-topic.md`)
   - Clear explanation of the concept
   - When and why to use it
   - Benefits and trade-offs
   - Code snippets
   - Links to implementation

2. **Implementation** (`implementations/your-topic/`)
   - Working code example
   - Multiple approaches if applicable
   - Comments explaining key parts
   - README with setup instructions

### 4. Content Guidelines

#### Documentation Style
- Use clear, concise language
- Include practical examples

#### Code Style
- Follow existing code formatting
- Add meaningful comments
- Use TypeScript where possible
- Include error handling
- Make it production-ready

#### File Structure
```
concepts/
├── your-topic.md              # Main documentation
implementations/
├── your-topic/
│   ├── README.md             # Setup instructions

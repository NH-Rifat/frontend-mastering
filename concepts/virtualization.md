# ðŸ”„ Virtualization

## What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is a technique used to efficiently render large lists by only rendering the visible items in the viewport. This dramatically improves performance when dealing with thousands or millions of items.

## Key Concepts

- **Viewport**: The visible area of the scrollable container
- **Virtual Items**: Items that exist in data but aren't rendered in DOM
- **Rendered Items**: Only the visible + buffer items that are actually in the DOM
- **Item Height**: Can be fixed or dynamic

## Why Use Virtualization?

1. **Performance**: Reduces DOM nodes, improving render performance
2. **Memory**: Less memory usage as fewer elements are in DOM
3. **Smooth Scrolling**: Maintains 60fps even with large datasets

## Common Use Cases

- Data tables with thousands of rows
- Chat applications with long message histories
- Product listings in e-commerce
- Social media feeds

## Implementation Strategy

1. Calculate visible range based on scroll position
2. Render only visible items + buffer
3. Use absolute positioning for proper spacing
4. Handle dynamic heights if needed
